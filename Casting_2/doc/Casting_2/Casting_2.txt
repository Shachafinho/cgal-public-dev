\section casting_sec_intro Introduction

Casting is a manufacturing process where liquid material is poured
into a mold having the shape of a desired product. After the material
solidifies, the product is pulled out of the mold.

This package provides a function that ....
The input polygon must satisfy two conditions as follows. First, it
has to be simple. Essentially, a simple polygon is topologically
equivalent to a disk; see Chapter \ref
Chapter_2D_Regularized_Boolean_Set-Operations "2D Regularized Boolean
Set-Operations" for the precise definition of simple
polygons. Secondly, not consecuitive three vertices can be linear. If
you suspect that the input polygon may not satisfy the latter
condition, pre-process the polygon to elliminate this ill-condition.
