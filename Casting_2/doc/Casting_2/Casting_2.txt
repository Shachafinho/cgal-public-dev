\section casting_sec_intro Introduction

Casting is a manufacturing process where liquid material is poured
into a cavity inside a mold, which has the shape of a desired
product. After the material solidifies, the product is pulled out of
the mold. Typically a mold is used to manufacture numerous copies of a
product, in which case we need to make sure that the solidified
product can be separated from its mold without breaking it.  The
challenge of designing a proper mold belongs to a larger topic termed
\emph{Movable Separability of Sets}; see \cgalCite{t-mss-85}
These problems become progressively more challenging as the allowable
separation motions becomes more complex (have more degrees of
freedom), the number of objects involved grows, or the shape of the
objects becomes more complicated.

This package provides a function called
`single_mold_translational_casting_2()` that given a simple polygon
\f$P\f$ it determines whether a cavity (of a mold in the plane) that
has the shape of \f$P\f$ can be used so that the polygon \f$P\f$ could
be pulled out of the mold without colliding into the mold (but
possibly sliding along the mold surface); see
\cgalFigureRef{casting_2_fig_mold} for an illustration. If the polygon
is <em>castable</em>, the function computes the set of top edges of
such cavities and the corresponding closed ranges of pull
directions. Assuming the top edge normal is parallel to the
\f$y\f$-axis, every direction in a range must have a positive
component in the positive \f$y\f$-direction.

The input polygon must satisfy two conditions as follows. First, it
has to be simple. Essentially, a simple polygon is topologically
equivalent to a disk; see Chapter \ref
Chapter_2D_Regularized_Boolean_Set-Operations "2D Regularized Boolean
Set-Operations" for the precise definition of simple
polygons. Secondly, not consecuitive three vertices can be linear. If
you suspect that the input polygon may not satisfy the latter
condition, pre-process the polygon to elliminate this ill-condition.
