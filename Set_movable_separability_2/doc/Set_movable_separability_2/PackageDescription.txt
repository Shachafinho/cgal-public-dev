\cgalPkgDesc{This package consists of the implementations of various predicates and operations related to castings of polygonal objects. In particular, it can be used to determine whether a mold for a polygonal object does exist. If a mold exists, the package can also be used to compute all possible orientations of the feasible molds and the corresponding motions needed to remove the casted object from the mold.}
